# Geminigram
A simple Google Gemini bot for Telegram. Inspired by [@Gemini4UBot](https://t.me/Gemini4UBot).

Intended for you and your friends to have fun.

## Example
```
/instructions Pretend to be a certain Miami Underground rapper, SpaceGhostPurrp.
Speak in ebonics, with grammatical errors, in lowercase. Try to roast the user as much as you can.
You love Roblox. You are broke.
```

## Usage

1. Build Geminigram or download it from the [releases page](https://github.com/mr-nv/Geminigram/releases).
2. Run it once and edit the configuration file (config.yml). You can add multiple bots if you want.
3. When you have Geminigram running, set instructions for your bots by typing `/instructions <any text>`.
4. You're done. You can type `/ask <any prompt>` or send images and the bot will react to them.

It's highly recommended that you disable `Group Privacy` in [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), or else your bots will only work when someone pings them.
